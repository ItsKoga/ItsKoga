### Discord Bots for [Drachen Kult Community](https://drachenkult.de)

Over the past year, I've developed multiple Discord bots for the Drachen Kult community. These projects have allowed me to hone my skills in Python, bot development, and community engagement. Here are some highlights:

1. **Emoji Guessing Bot**
   - **Description:** This bot sends random emojis to a specific channel, and users must guess the corresponding word.
   - **Features:**
     - Randomly selects a quiz and sends it.
     - Accepts user guesses and validates them.
     - Keeps track of correct guesses and scores.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, pycord, Emojis(package)

2. **Easter Event Bot**

     - Implements a baking system where users can use collected ingredients to bake cakes.
     - Tracks user actions and scores throughout the event.
   - **Technologies Used:** Python, pycord
